## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## The Game

The Goal of the Memory Game is to find all the matching Cards in the Deck.

Click a card to show its Symbol. Click a second card to find its matching Pair.
If the Symbols do not match both cards will be flipped Back. If they match both Cards will stay open and change color to green.

You win the Game by matching all the Cards. When you win the Game a screen will show you how many attempts you needed and how long it took you to finish. You can start another Game by clicking "Restart"
There will also be a Star Count to show you how well you played that round.
For less than 12 moves you get a 3 Star Rating, for 13 to 16 moves a 2 Star Score, 17 to 20 a 1 Star Score and for more than 21 moves a 0 Star Score.

You can also restart the game by clicking the symbol in the upper right corner.
